Each tested machine learning algorithm is included with samples of generated PNN figures and the final figure in PNN_Figures.
TrainTestCombinedData-PNN-wsl.py is utilized to generate respective figures and includes the final architecture chosen.

-Training Configuration for each machine learning model is located in CONFIG_MODEL_TRAINING.py
	-TARGETFILE - updates input for each tested machine learning algorithm script
	-PROJECT_NAME - updates project name written in figure for each tested machine learning algorithm
